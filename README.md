Weather App Hackathon
Brief
Welcome to the Weather App Hackathon! Over the past week, you've been diving deeper into JavaScript, learning about the DOM, APIs, and how to make API calls using fetch. It's time to apply what you've learned. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to plan, develop, and present a fully functioning weather app in a single day.

Objectives
Build an app leveraging a third-party weather API.
Work in a team using the Driver-Navigator/pair programming approach.
Practice planning before jumping into coding.
Deliver an MVP within a tight timeframe.
Development Rules
Work in pairs or threes, using the Driver-Navigator approach for coding. Make sure to switch roles regularly!
Make frequent, small commits to track and manage changes easily.
Plan before you code. Write pseudocode as comments in your JavaScript file so it acts as a roadmap when you start to code. Break down each step and think through the logic.
Remember: The goal is to solve the problem before you even start coding in JavaScript. Think of the actual code as simply translating your well-thought-out plan into syntax the computer understands. Working this way will make the development process more organised. Good software development is as much about planning and understanding as it is about writing the code.

Technical Requirements
Programming Language: JavaScript.
Environment: The Browser.
UI: Use standard HTML & CSS.
External API: Utilise a public API for real-time weather data.
Milestones
Planning and Initial Setup - Tip: Take time to thoroughly explore the API documentation. Understand what the API can do and what its limitations are. Use tools like ThunderClient or Postman to test API calls and explore what data gets returned.
Fetch and output today's weather data for a fixed location (e.g. London) to the console.
Create a basic UI and display the weather data.
Stretch Goals, Testing & Debugging.
Stretch Goals
Add visual elements like weather icons or images.
Add unit conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
Include a weekly weather forecast.
Add a feature allowing the user to input a location.
Presentation Guidelines
Prepare a 4-minute end-of-day demo.
Each team will present to a coach.
Each team member must participate in the presentation.
Evaluation Criteria
Teamwork: How well did the team work together?
Presentation: Was the presentation clear, concise, and kept on time?
Plan Quality: How well was the project planned out?
Code Quality: Is the code clean, formatted and organised?
Git Practices: Were changes documented with frequent, clear commits?
Functionality: Does the game work as intended?
Completion: Are all required features implemented?
